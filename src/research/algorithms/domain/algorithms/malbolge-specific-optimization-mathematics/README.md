# Malbolge-specific optimization mathematics

This directory is the executable mirror for research ID
`malbolge-specific-optimization-mathematics`. The human research record uses the
same ID under `docs/research/algorithms/`, and its mathematical contract, when
present, uses the same ID under `math/algorithms/`.

Implementations in Rust, C, CUDA, Python, or another justified language live
together here because the algorithm, not the language, owns the research.
Regenerable results belong in `out/` and remain Git ignored.

The active first experiment studies exact CPU VM table/factorization reductions.
Its versioned configuration is `experiment.toml`; raw performance evidence lives
under `benchmarks/interpreter/evidence/2026-07-26-windows-x86_64/`, while
semantic acceptance is owned by
`src/specification/formal-model/math/specification/correspondence.toml`.

The current research surface also exposes an exact classic crazy-target
full-domain preimage count. Its product-of-per-trit-multiplicities equation and
the derived tight 1,024-preimage global ceiling, exact zero-or-power-of-two
cardinality spectrum, accumulator-specific `2^(10-n2(a))` worst-target bound,
exact `2^(10-n2(a))*3^n2(a)` reachable-target count, and
`C(10,k)*2^(10-k)` accumulator-class cardinality, and the exact `7^10`
reachable accumulator/target-pair count are registered in the mathematical
correspondence manifest; all are correctness/search-bound results,
not benchmark-derived speedup claims. The optimizer exposes both state-level
counts, the complete eleven-class partition, and the global reachable-pair
count directly from the normative trit table.
