# Guest C Library Function Boundary

## Purpose

This function owns the guest-visible C library contract and implementations
that execute as ordinary guest code. It separates executable routines from
contracted facilities whose runtime implementation belongs to a later lane.

## Ownership

- Owns: Guest libc declarations and repository-owned guest C implementations.
- Authority: `function.yml` plus the canonical `c-libc-v1.json` specification.

## Prohibitions

- Must not: Resolve guest library calls through host libc or host `libm`.
- Must not: Treat native debug adapters as guest-runtime conformance evidence.

## Navigation

- `contract/include/`: guest headers backed by executable guest code.
- `domain/`: deterministic freestanding implementations of admitted routines.

## Status

Executable v1 memory, narrow-string, exact binary64 math, and canonical
nearest-ties-even `sqrt` are implemented. Allocation
wrappers are now implemented over the one-time startup-bound guest heap core,
but remain unavailable in the canonical libc authority until compiler-generated
startup proves the heap bind before user code. `getchar`/`putchar` wrappers are
also implemented over stable declaration-only byte intrinsics, but remain
unavailable until downstream lowering proves those intrinsic identities execute
selected-profile input/output. Formatting remains unavailable.

Transcendental math is also still unavailable, but an internal raw-bit front
end now resolves
proved small-angle `sin`/`cos` results plus the complete `atan2` zero/infinity
matrix. Finite nonzero `atan2` inputs are also reduced exactly to a normalized
rational in `[0, 1]` with explicit swap and sign geometry before any future
numerical kernel.
