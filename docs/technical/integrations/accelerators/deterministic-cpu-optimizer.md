# Deterministic CPU optimizer

## Status

Proposed

## Purpose

Implement a correct CPU reference optimizer and search engine that remains
available without a GPU and serves as the specification-conformant baseline on
both x86-64 and AArch64 hosts.

## Scope

This document governs the following declared TODO scope:

- `accelerator/cpu/`
- `algorithms/`
- `optimizer/`
- `benchmarks/accelerator/`
- `tests/optimizer/`

## Current Behavior

### Proposed Model

This record defines the contract that implementation must satisfy for
`deterministic-cpu-optimizer`. The implementation may change internal
representation or language choices without changing the observable behavior,
trust boundary, or ownership rules stated by its governing decisions.

### Implementation Status

Not implemented. This proposed contract does not claim executable support yet.

## Invariants

- The CPU-only optimizer/search path produces and verifies candidates without
  GPU availability on both x86-64 and AArch64.
- Architecture-specific performance tuning may differ, but candidate semantics,
  verifier obligations, and experiment identity remain shared.
- A CPU/reference path remains sufficient for correctness, and accelerator
  failure/unavailability changes performance rather than semantic acceptance.

## Failure Behavior

Missing hardware, resource exhaustion, or accelerator disagreement falls back or
fails explicitly without changing correctness rules.

## Verification

- Expected durable artifact surface: `accelerator/cpu/`, `algorithms/`,
  `optimizer/`, `benchmarks/accelerator/`, `tests/optimizer/`.
- Required evidence: CPU/reference differential results, device/resource
  metadata, failure/fallback tests, and benchmark samples for claimed speedups.
- Prerequisite completion evidence: `safe-rust-malbolge-vm`,
  `translation-validation`, `compiler-algorithm-experimentation-platform`.
