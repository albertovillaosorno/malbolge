# Parametric guest byte-stream emission

## Status

Proposed. Generalized compiler behavior and its proof are not implemented.

## Purpose

**First experiment, then verify.** Try one demanding, complete C program
before increasing output-byte counts or the verification fixture inventory.
Repair the first real compiler gap and rerun the same whole program; only
after success introduce a generated verification matrix and independent
end-to-end oracle. The maximum N is not a product progress metric.

## Scope

The existing corpus is useful regression history and may remain SHA-pinned.
A new example must establish a previously untested semantic boundary.
Increasing the byte count from 48 to 49 without such a boundary is not
an acceptable completion milestone.

The work belongs to the C frontend, typed lowering, layout backend, VM,
and their tests. It does not require a single enormous hand-authored C file
or hundreds of individual documentation pages.

## Current Behavior

### First complex C experiment

The following compact function uses local state, a bounded loop, a branch,
integer arithmetic, and observable guest output. It was intentionally tried
as a single complete program before creating any additional small cases.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void emit(void) {
    unsigned a = 1U;
    unsigned b = 1U;
    for (unsigned i = 0U; i < 12U; ++i) {
        unsigned next = (a + b) & 255U;
        if ((next & 1U) == 0U) {
            putchar((int)next);
        } else {
            putchar((int)(next ^ 0x5AU));
        }
        a = b;
        b = next;
    }
}
```

An independently derived reference returns these twelve bytes:
`02 59 5f 08 57 4f 22 6d 03 90 b3 23`. The pinned compiler attempt on
2026-11-05 failed at `c2malbolge_json` with the diagnostic `Malformed`,
before publication of a guest program. This is a real failed
experiment, not proof that the compiler supports general C.

The first adapter defect was confirmed and fixed in DCO commit
`e5773e312`: the Clang schema already defined `storage_duration`, but the
closed JSON adapter had omitted it. The adapter now admits the specified
`automatic`, `static`, and `thread` values as metadata while still rejecting
unknown fields and values. Its supported effect-free and literal-output
paths reject that extra metadata instead of silently discarding state.

With the same program and updated adapter, the real pinned pipeline now
reports `Unsupported; unlowered C declaration-statement` at the first local
variable, with the C source line and column, and publishes no guest. The
tracked experiment is
`tests/compiler/c-frontend/accepted/conditional_fibonacci.c`, replayed by
`tests/test_compound_c_pipeline.py`; its oracle is independently calculated.
That test requires explicit failure while state semantics are unsupported
and will require actual normative guest-VM parity if compilation succeeds.
This is a repaired **schema/diagnostic** gap, not completed C lowering.

### First source-bound automatic-local output

A separate pinned-Clang source now exercises a real automatic `unsigned`
local initialized to `65U`, then read by `putchar(value)`. The closed JSON
adapter admits the exact single-definition/single-use AST, connects the
source-bound declaration to its read, and promotes this unmodified constant
local to a typed byte SSA value. Its `0..255` admission range preserves the
unsigned-to-signed call conversion and low-byte output for this slice.

The existing byte backend independently checks its selected guest witness.
The compiled capsule emitted `0x41` under the normative profile VM in
31 steps on 2026-11-05. The tracked regression is
`tests/compiler/c-frontend/accepted/local_initialized_output.c`, with native
process/VM acceptance and tampered-node rejection tests. The declaration
and its use must carry the same canonical Clang symbol reference.

This is source-bound constant propagation for one immutable local, **not**
general automatic storage, mutable variable assignment, or guest integer
computation. An out-of-range or nonliteral initializer, additional effect,
branch, loop, or unsupported symbol relationship must reject without
publishing an artifact.

### Ordered literal writes to an automatic local

The pinned Clang experiment `local_reassigned_output.c` initializes one
`unsigned` local with `0U`, then writes `66U` and `65U`, and outputs the local.
Before the repair, the adapter refused the whole source at the first local
statement and published nothing. The repaired adapter admits at most eight
consecutive `=` assignments of source-backed `u32` literals in `0..255`.
It checks their exact AST ancestry, spans, order, and matching symbol before
eliminating the unobservable dead stores. Only the final literal is emitted as
a source-attributed typed byte SSA value, with one real guest output effect.
The actual current-profile VM emits `41` (hex) in 31 steps. Arithmetic
involving the prior local value was unsupported at this stage.

This is bounded dead-store elimination, not a guest implementation of general
mutable storage. Neither runtime arithmetic nor aliases, multiple variables,
conditional execution, or loops are supported by this projection. The original
Fibonacci program still refuses at its first declaration and remains the P0
end-to-end acceptance target.

### Bounded prior-value arithmetic writes

The pinned C fixture `local_arithmetic_output.c` contains one automatic
unsigned local initialized with `60U`. It then computes `value + 8U`,
`value ^ 3U`, and `value - 6U` through three source-bound assignments.
The initial value and three operators are checked against the complete
Clang AST, including exact symbol references, types, node ancestry and
nonoverlapping source spans. The adapter reads the previous proven value
for each operation and admits only results in `0..255`; it rejects
multiplication, unbounded or wrapping intermediate arithmetic, aliases,
foreign reads and extra effects. The live typed SSA constant receives the
last arithmetic expression's source span rather than an invented literal.

The independently verified guest output is `41` (hex), produced by the
existing Malbolge byte-output witness in 31 normative VM steps. The guest
performs **output**, not the arithmetic: this route is source-constant
propagation and dead-store elimination, not a runtime arithmetic backend.
General state, multiple locals, branches and loops still need actual
ternary and layout lowering. The original Fibonacci target remains blocked.

### Cross-local, source-proven constant flow

A new whole-source experiment `local_multi_output.c` declares three separate
`unsigned` locals, initializes `a` and `b` to `60U` and `8U`, initializes
`result` from their sum, then applies XOR `3U` and subtraction `6U` before
`putchar(result)`. The original pinned Clang-to-guest pipeline refused its
first declaration and published no guest artifact. The repaired JSON adapter
proves ordered, symbol-matched reads across distinct locals, exact AST
ancestry and spans, and every intermediate result within `0..255`. It accepts
up to eight distinct automatic unsigned locals, 16 straight-line writes and
bounded expression depth, with one final output call. Undeclared reads,
aliases, unchecked overflow, extra effects, control flow and other calls fail
closed. The live source expression anchors the final typed byte definition.

The actual emitted `.malbolge` capsule outputs `0x41` in 31 normative VM
steps. `tests/test_compound_c_pipeline.py` compares the real guest output
against `(60 + 8) ^ 3 - 6`, and the pinned JSON mutation regression proves
foreign symbols and unsupported effects refuse admission. Arithmetic remains
compile-time constant propagation; the guest performs only the witnessed byte
output. General locals, runtime arithmetic and loops are **not** implemented.
The original Fibonacci target continues to reject at its first declaration.

### Bounded source-proven conditional selection

A new demanding C branch experiment uses three initialized unsigned locals,
computes a cross-local sum, and selects one of two updates under
`if ((result & 1U) == 0U)`. The pinned frontend first rejected this whole
source at its first declaration without publishing any guest program. The
repaired multi-local projection checks the `i32` equality, nested unsigned
AND, all symbol references, exact source ancestry and spans, and one
side-effect-closed assignment in **each** brace-delimited arm. It evaluates
both arm shapes against the same proven incoming constants and retains
only the selected successor state before the final `putchar`.

Two source-backed variants exercise opposite outcomes: `60 + 6` selects
`result ^ 3U`, while `60 + 7` selects `result ^ 2U`. Typed-IR assertions
confirm that the live definition comes from the correct C line in each
variant. Both actual capsules output `41` (hex) in 31 normative VM steps.
Foreign reads, wrong operators, missing or nested arms, extra effects and
malformed metadata reject. At most 16 bounded writes are admitted,
counting both branch arms, and every intermediate arithmetic value must
fit `u8`. This is compile-time constant propagation, not an executable
guest branch or generalized mutable state. The original twelve-output
Fibonacci program still refuses at its first declaration; runtime loops,
variable-dependent output, and guest control flow remain pending.

### Conditional expression-derived output

The tracked pinned Clang source `local_expression_output.c` now selects a
proven branch update across three `unsigned` locals, then outputs the
**expression** `(int)(result ^ 3U)` instead of outputting a bare local. A
closed argument walker checks the explicit conversion, C parentheses, nested
unsigned arithmetic and source-bound local reference; any unconsumed effect
or mismatched Clang ancestry refuses publication. A red-first Rust regression
and mutated-node tests establish that the byte's SSA origin is the actual
call argument rather than an earlier variable write.

Two real native C-to-Malbolge compiler runs select different branch outcomes:
the first produces guest byte `0x41` in 31 VM steps; the second changes the
branch and argument constant and produces `0x42` in 69 VM steps. Independent
C arithmetic gives those values, and `tests/test_compound_c_pipeline.py`
checks actual guest output and rejects multiplication without an artifact.
A distinct `0x40` experiment reached the layout backend but was refused as
`UnsupportedEffectTrace`: the current positional single-byte guest witness
table does not contain that byte. The compiler did not fabricate guest output.
All arithmetic and control flow in the admitted case is still evaluated at
compile time; guest runtime computation, general loops and multi-byte dynamic
output remain unimplemented. The original Fibonacci acceptance is pending.

### Nonbyte unsigned intermediates with source-proven masking

The original Fibonacci loop computes `next = (a + b) & 255U`, which may
have a nonbyte sum even when the stored result is a byte. A pinned Clang
probe with `a = 233U` and `b = 144U` initially refused in the multi-local
adapter because the expression walker did not admit its nested parentheses.
The revised bounded evaluator retains the **checked `u32`** value 377 through
the inner addition, applies `& 255U`, and only then proves the byte 121
assigned to `next`. Source-proven Clang parentheses and an explicit
`putchar((int)next)` cast are now admitted while unknown operations, symbols,
AST mutations and extra effects still refuse. The leaf literals and each
materialized local remain byte-bounded; this is neither arbitrary 32-bit
C lowering nor guest runtime computation.

In a complete loop-free branch probe, the odd condition selects XOR 56,
producing `0x41` in 31 normative VM steps. An independent second C variant
uses `232 + 144`, selects the even condition with XOR 58, and produces
`0x42` in 69 normative VM steps. Both real guest capsules were compared
against independent C arithmetic and a pinned JSON regression verifies the
actual typed source span. The original twelve-byte Fibonacci experiment
still refuses its first declaration: its stateful `for`, repeated output,
and guest control flow remain missing and P0 stays open.

### Closed, statically evaluated C for-loop state

A new pinned Clang experiment
`tests/compiler/c-frontend/accepted/local_static_loop_output.c` reuses
Fibonacci-like unsigned locals in `for (unsigned i = 0U; i < 8U; ++i)`.
Its body declares an iteration-local `next`, computes a masked sum, selects
one of two source-proven assignments with `if/else`, and transfers the state
into `a` and `b`. A single `putchar` after the loop reads the final state.
The original full source was attempted first and still rejects because it
emits *inside* its loop.

The bounded adapter now proves an exact Clang `for-statement` declaration,
`u32` counter read, `i32` less-than comparison against a byte literal,
`++` increment, brace-delimited body and matching symbol/span ancestry.
It accepts only a zero-initialized, private `unsigned` counter with a bound
from 1 through 12. Each iteration replays the **same checked AST** against
proven local values, disposes of loop-body locals on scope exit and advances
the counter. Assignments to the counter, nested loops, effects inside the
loop, unsupported operations, and out-of-budget iteration bounds reject.
The body may contain bounded local declarations, assignments, and the
previously proven closed conditional assignments. All materialized locals
stay byte-sized; wider checked unsigned intermediates require masking.
The result is one constant-SSA byte with a real guest output, **not** a
Malbolge loop or guest runtime arithmetic.

Independent unsigned-C arithmetic yields `a=26`, `b=42` after eight
iterations and `42 ^ 107 = 65`. The real source-to-Malbolge pipeline emits
`0x41` in 31 normative VM steps, with a source variant at seven iterations
also producing `0x41` after independent oracle adjustment. Tests assert
changed counter identities, loop controls, branches and added effects refuse
publication. The complete twelve-byte Fibonacci program remains blocked by
loop-body output and dynamic guest control-flow realization.

The remaining first semantic gap for the original complete program is the
**general runtime** local-variable declaration, initialization, read/write
and provenance needed through typed IR and ternary lowering. The same
program additionally needs arithmetic, bounded loops, conditional branches,
and value-dependent `putchar`; the active
`docs/todo/open/compiler/ternary-machine-lowering.mdc` and
`docs/todo/open/compiler/malbolge-layout-and-encoding-backend.mdc` own the
subsequent executable target and control-flow realization. Re-run the **same**
complete program after each meaningful capability correction; retire this P0
only when its actual guest VM output matches the independent reference.

Do not substitute a host output transcript for guest execution or retreat
to another 49-byte literal-output demonstration to avoid this failure.

### Bounded branch-selected output inside a source-proven loop

The full twelve-iteration, branch-selected-output Fibonacci program was
retried. Before this change it still failed at the first local declaration.
A source-close variant, `local_loop_branch_output.c`, retains the same
three-state updates, masked sum, conditional and `putchar` inside the loop,
but proves zero using `next ^ next` in the even arm and `next - next` in
the odd arm. The pinned Clang AST is consumed completely for both arms on
every iteration; only the selected call is added to the ordered typed
output effects. Its `u32` state and loop counter are still **evaluated by
the compiler**, not by Malbolge.

The selected calls produce twelve verified zero bytes, with four even and
eight odd arms. The canonical typed IR contains one zero-valued SSA
constant and twelve distinct `ByteOutput` effects. The existing
zero-output backend generates a real guest capsule, and the normative VM
emits `00` twelve times in thirteen steps; a seven-iteration variant
emits seven zero bytes in eight steps. Tests refuse an unknown callee,
altered predicate, extra effects and a nonzero stream without publishing
a guest artifact. This is a new observable control-flow effect boundary,
not a fixed literal-count fixture.

The original compound program still requires **arbitrary nonzero output
sequences**: its reference is `02 59 5f 08 57 4f 22 6d 03 90 b3 23`.
The finite witnessed backend cannot yet realize that ordered sequence,
and the adapter explicitly rejects the unverified trace. General guest
state, dynamic loop execution and P0 completion remain pending.

### Later verification matrix

Only after the complete experiment succeeds, use a deterministic corpus
generator to broaden coverage without manually creating one source and
technical document for every output length.

One versioned matrix specification declares a fixed seed, the C output
program template, target profile, resource limits, and oracle encoding.
The generator uses deterministic byte vectors of lengths 0, 1, 2, 3, 7,
8, 16, 32, 48, 64, 128, and 256, plus budgeted seeded lengths.

The vectors cover ASCII, all 32 low control bytes, zero, 0xff, high-bit
bytes, repeated bytes, and distinct-byte permutations. More than 256
positions necessarily permit repeats even when testing all byte values.

## Invariants

- Generate cases from inputs and a seed, not from separate manual fixtures.
- Translate each generated C program through the real compiler frontend,
  typed lowering, layout backend, and published Malbolge artifact.
- Run the actual guest in the normative VM under an explicit step budget.
  Byte output must come from guest behavior, not a host-generated substitute.
- Compare VM output to an independent byte-oracle before accepting a case.
  Record compiler identity, source hash, output hash, steps, and resources.
- One parameterized test runner must replay the whole retained corpus.
  Existing teaching artifacts keep their own source and SHA identities.
- Reject unsupported input, missing tools, timeouts, output drift, and
  incomplete lowering with typed failures rather than fabricated success.
- Test metamorphic relations such as repeated prefixes, concatenation,
  permutation, and equivalent C syntax only when the compiler promises
  the corresponding source semantics and exact output relation.
- Prevent regression masking: one failing case reports its seed, vector,
  source artifact, first byte mismatch, and reproducible command.
- Enforce an explicit wall time, memory, VM-step, and case-count budget.
  A truncated run is incomplete; it cannot publish a green receipt.
- A case that exposes a missing C feature becomes a compiler feature task
  with a red-first regression, not another arbitrary `emit-N` milestone.
- Use coverage of implemented C semantics, control flow, memory safety,
  input/output, and compiler lowering as progress metrics, not the maximum N.

## Failure Behavior

Do not infer support for general C, arbitrary loops, dynamic input, or
unbounded output from a finite sequence of literal `putchar` programs.
A single mega-source that prints 256 constants is also only one witness;
it does not replace the parameterized semantic and metamorphic matrix.

A compiler can pass every retained fixed example while mishandling a
single input-dependent expression. The matrix must detect such defects,
retain the smallest reproducer, and avoid adding repetitive manual pages.

## Verification

Start by running `python3.14 -B -m unittest` on the existing
`tests.test_versioned_example_corpus` matrix. A new generator and
parameterized contract test shall add deterministic seeded cases without
requiring one new test module for every output length.

The mandatory evidence is exact C-to-Malbolge compilation, independent
VM output and trace, source/guest digests, finite budgets, negative cases,
reproducible seed replay, and no dependence on untrusted host output.

Completion means the generalization is tested across the declared matrix,
not merely that the next individual `emit-N` example works. If input or
control-flow lowering is not supported, report that precise gap and leave
the product claim incomplete rather than extending examples forever.
