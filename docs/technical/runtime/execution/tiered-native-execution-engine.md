# Tiered native execution engine

## Status

Proposed

## Purpose

Build a tiered execution engine instead of choosing between interpretation, AOT,
and JIT. Decode Malbolge into a compact execution IR, simplify that IR through
verified state-graph mathematics, compile demonstrably stable regions to native
machine code before execution, specialize hot or mutation-sensitive regions at
runtime, and deoptimize safely to the interpreter whenever a code-version guard
or speculative assumption fails. The normative VM contract remains the semantic
baseline; native tiers are accelerators of identical observable behavior.

## Scope

This document governs the following declared TODO scope:

- `vm/`
- `execution/`
- `tests/vm/`
- `benchmarks/interpreter/`

## Current Behavior

### Proposed Model

This record defines the contract that implementation must satisfy for
`tiered-native-execution-engine`. The implementation may change internal
representation or language choices without changing the observable behavior,
trust boundary, or ownership rules stated by its governing decisions.

### Implementation Status

Not implemented. This proposed contract does not claim executable support yet.

## Invariants

- Interpreter, AOT, JIT, native cache, and deoptimization share one observable
  VM contract; disabling every native tier produces the same guest behavior.
- Observable state, I/O, termination, and diagnostics match the declared
  semantic profile across positive, boundary, and adversarial fixtures.

## Failure Behavior

Invalid programs, unsupported profiles, or broken native assumptions fail
deterministically without changing guest-visible state silently.

## Verification

- Expected durable artifact surface: `vm/`, `execution/`, `tests/vm/`,
  `benchmarks/interpreter/`.
- Required evidence: semantic fixtures, state/I/O traces where diagnostic, and
  differential results against independent specification-conformant
  implementations; the historical interpreter is compared only on its documented
  agreement domain.
- Prerequisite completion evidence: `safe-rust-malbolge-vm`,
  `self-modification-state-graph-optimizer`.
