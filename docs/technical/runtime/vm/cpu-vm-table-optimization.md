# CPU VM table optimization

## Status

Proposed

## Purpose

Optimize scalar execution with precomputed rotate tables, position-dependent
decode tables, efficient crazy-operation decomposition, cheap pointer updates,
and benchmarked micro-optimizations without semantic drift.

## Scope

This document governs the following declared TODO scope:

- `vm/`
- `execution/`
- `tests/vm/`
- `benchmarks/interpreter/`

## Current Behavior

### Proposed Model

This record defines the contract that implementation must satisfy for
`cpu-vm-table-optimization`. The implementation may change internal
representation or language choices without changing the observable behavior,
trust boundary, or ownership rules stated by its governing decisions.

### Implementation Status

Not implemented. This proposed contract does not claim executable support yet.

## Invariants

- Lookup tables or predecoded forms measurably reduce CPU work while
  exhaustive/property checks prove equality to the scalar rotate/crazy/decode
  definitions.
- Observable state, I/O, termination, and diagnostics match the declared
  semantic profile across positive, boundary, and adversarial fixtures.
- Performance conclusions use equivalent workloads and report raw-sample
  provenance, resource budgets, dispersion/uncertainty, and failure/success
  behavior rather than only a best-case number.

## Failure Behavior

Invalid programs, unsupported profiles, or broken native assumptions fail
deterministically without changing guest-visible state silently.

## Verification

- Expected durable artifact surface: `vm/`, `execution/`, `tests/vm/`,
  `benchmarks/interpreter/`.
- Required evidence: semantic fixtures, state/I/O traces where diagnostic, and
  differential results against independent specification-conformant
  implementations; the historical interpreter is compared only on its documented
  agreement domain.
- Prerequisite completion evidence: `safe-rust-malbolge-vm`.
- Performance evidence pending: raw measurements plus a reproducible
  scaling/statistical summary tied to exact workload and hardware/software
  identity.
