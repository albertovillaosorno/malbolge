# Independent pure C Malbolge VM

## Status

Proposed

## Purpose

Implement a small auditable pure-C VM independently from the stabilized
specification rather than mechanically translating the Rust implementation.

## Scope

This document governs the following declared TODO scope:

- `vm/`
- `execution/`
- `tests/vm/`
- `benchmarks/interpreter/`

## Current Behavior

### Proposed Model

This record defines the contract that implementation must satisfy for
`independent-pure-c-malbolge-vm`. The implementation may change internal
representation or language choices without changing the observable behavior,
trust boundary, or ownership rules stated by its governing decisions.

### Implementation Status

Not implemented. This proposed contract does not claim executable support yet.

## Invariants

- The C VM is independently implemented from the stabilized specification, is
  small enough to audit, and does not mechanically mirror Rust control structure
  or share semantic implementation code.
- Observable state, I/O, termination, and diagnostics match the declared
  semantic profile across positive, boundary, and adversarial fixtures.

## Failure Behavior

Invalid programs, unsupported profiles, or broken native assumptions fail
deterministically without changing guest-visible state silently.

## Verification

- Expected durable artifact surface: `vm/`, `execution/`, `tests/vm/`,
  `benchmarks/interpreter/`.
- Required evidence: semantic fixtures, state/I/O traces where diagnostic, and
  differential results against independent specification-conformant
  implementations; the historical interpreter is compared only on its documented
  agreement domain.
- Prerequisite completion evidence: `canonical-malbolge-target-profile`,
  `historical-malbolge-semantics-specification`.
