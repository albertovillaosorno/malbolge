# Emitted Malbolge static analyzer

## Status

Active implementation

## Purpose

Analyze generated Malbolge for lexical and address validity, self-modification,
control-flow reachability, code/data aliasing, wraparound, dataflow, invalid
executable cells, and input-dependent cycles or hangs.

## Scope

This document governs the following declared TODO scope:

- `verifier/`
- `tests/differential/`
- `tests/exhaustive/`
- `tests/fuzz/`

## Current Behavior

### Implemented initial-image slice

`verifier/emitted_malbolge.py` statically inspects raw `malbolge-1998` source
without executing guest instructions. It applies the historical loader's six
C-locale whitespace bytes, graphical ASCII boundary, two-word recurrence base,
59,049-word capacity, and position-dependent 94-cell decode table. Reports are
canonical JSON and include the exact historical profile identity/capacity,
required source words, SHA-256 of the exact raw source bytes, admitted initial
cells with original byte offsets, stable findings, and analysis limits. The
report also records that the historical profile's address range is structurally
closed: code/data pointers and memory words share `0..=59048`, and pointer
successors wrap modulo 59,049.

Initial-image admission is deliberately narrower than whole-program safety. The
current slice does not claim dynamic control-flow reachability, dataflow,
code/data aliasing, evolving self-modification, source-map context, whether a
particular execution reaches pointer wraparound, or input-dependent cycle/hang
detection. Those remain open under this TODO.

## Invariants

- The fixed historical address range is closed structurally; this does not
  imply which addresses are reachable or whether a particular run wraps a
  pointer.
- Initial-image admission never implies dynamic control-flow, dataflow,
  self-modification, aliasing, source-map, or cycle/hang safety.
- Every reported initial cell preserves its loaded position and raw-source byte
  offset, and every report binds the exact source bytes and historical profile.
- Future dynamic analyses must state their bounded assumptions rather than
  executing arbitrary guest work to completion or treating unknown as safe.
- The verifier is tested against valid cases and deliberately mutated invalid
  cases so acceptance and rejection boundaries are evidenced independently.

## Failure Behavior

Unknown or unproved equivalence is rejection or an explicitly bounded result,
never implicit acceptance. The CLI prints canonical JSON for both admitted and
rejected initial images, returning a nonzero status when the image is rejected.
Unreadable source fails before a semantic report is emitted.

## Verification

- Expected durable artifact surface: `verifier/`, `tests/differential/`,
  `tests/exhaustive/`, `tests/fuzz/`.
- Required evidence: known-valid fixtures, seeded invalid mutations,
  counterexamples for rejected candidates, and deterministic replay.
- Prerequisite completion evidence: `safe-rust-malbolge-vm`,
  `canonical-malbolge-target-profile`.
- Current executable evidence covers known-valid source, exact loader
  whitespace, lexical rejection, recurrence underflow, historical capacity,
  all 8,836 graphical-byte/position decode pairs against an independent table
  anchored to the preserved historical interpreter `xlat1`, load-admission
  parity anchored to its `strchr("ji*p</vo", ...)` check, historical pointer
  assignment/wrap closure, positional decode rejection, byte-exact CLI/library
  report parity, explicit analysis limits,
  CLI semantic-rejection status, and CLI read failure.
