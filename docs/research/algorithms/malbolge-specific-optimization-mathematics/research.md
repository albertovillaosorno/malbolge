# Malbolge-specific optimization mathematics

## Status

Proposed

## Research Question

Does `malbolge-specific-optimization-mathematics` provide a reproducible
verified benefit over its declared baseline for the Malbolge compiler or
execution problem without weakening semantic correctness?

## Background

Derive algebraic decompositions, lookup-table factorizations, state reductions,
canonical forms, and lower bounds that reduce synthesis search before brute
force or stochastic optimization begins.

- Status: Proposed
- Research ID: `malbolge-specific-optimization-mathematics`
- Last reviewed: 2026-07-26

## Prior Work

- `../../../bibliography/publications/superoptimization/egg.md`

## Hypothesis

- H1: the proposed technique improves at least one preregistered objective under
  an equivalent resource budget while all accepted outputs pass the independent
  verifier.
- H0/rejection condition: the technique is unsound, cannot reproduce its result,
  or provides no meaningful advantage over the declared baseline on the admitted
  challenge distribution.

## Method

The executable mirror lives at
`algorithms/malbolge-specific-optimization-mathematics/`. Experiments use
versioned configuration, explicit seeds where stochastic behavior exists, fixed
resource budgets, parametric challenge identities, and the same verifier used
for baselines. Raw regenerable output stays in the mirror's Git-ignored `out/`.

## Evidence

Candidate generation, heuristics, models, and accelerators are untrusted. A
research result can compare quality or cost only after the trusted semantic
verifier accepts the candidate under the declared target profile.

- Derived canonical forms, factorizations, bounds, and algebraic reductions
  state applicability conditions and are benchmarked only after equivalence
  evidence is established.
- Definitions state domains and assumptions precisely; executable code cannot
  claim a mathematical reduction outside those stated preconditions.
- Every correctness-relevant equation or equivalence used by implementation has
  explicit domain assumptions and a traceable executable correspondence check.

## Results

No experiment result is recorded yet.

## Threats to Validity

Initial threats include challenge-family bias, hardware/toolchain sensitivity,
search-seed variance, verifier bounds, and overfitting to small Malbolge blocks.
Each experiment must narrow these threats before drawing a conclusion.

## Conclusion

No conclusion is accepted before reproducible evidence exists.
